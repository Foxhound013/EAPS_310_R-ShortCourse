# Installing R

  Your first step in getting started with R is installing the programming language. At the time of writing this article, version 3.6.2 is the latest release (NOTE: You don't want a pre-release version, you'll want the latest stable version). On the CRAN home page (https://www.r-project.org/), under "Getting Started", there will be a link to *download R*. Clicking this link will let you select a "mirror". This is just R lingo for a location that stores the installers and packages you can use in R. Selecting 0-Cloud will be a good choice regardless of where you're at. After selecting a mirror you'll be directed to a page to download R for Linux, MacOS, or Windows. Select your OS and download R.
  
  Once R finishes downloading, run the installer with the default settings and R will be ready to go on your system!
  
  The next step will be setting up our code editing environment, R Studio.

# Installing RStudio
  Navigate to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download and select the installer that matches your OS be it Linux, MacOS, or Windows. Follow the steps provided by the installer and you'll be up and running with RStudio in no time. RStudio should detect the install location of R on your system.

# Rejoice!
  Hopefully everything has went well for you up to this point. If you've run into problems, try searching your problem online first. It is very likely that someone has had your same problem before. If you still can't sort it out, don't hesitate to reach out to the instructor or teaching assistant.

# One Quick Tip Before We Go
  If you've spent any time at all looking at R code, you've probably noticed the super strange assignment operator (i.e. the <- thingy). I beleive in most scenarios, you can simply use = in its place but there may be certain scenarios where this is not the case. In any case, its best to adopt the standards of the language your working in. Typing out the assignment operator is somewhat painful but there is a shortcut that makes it faster, hitting the alt and - key at the same time will result in the assignment operator. It becomes second nature pretty quickly once you start using it.
