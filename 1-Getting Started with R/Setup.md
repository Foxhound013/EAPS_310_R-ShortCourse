# Installing R

Your first step in getting started with R is installing the programming language. At the time of writing this article, version 3.6.2 is the latest release (NOTE: You don't want a pre-release version, you'll want the latest stable version). On the CRAN home page (https://www.r-project.org/), under "Getting Started", there will be a link to *download R*. Clicking this link will let you select a "mirror". This is just R lingo for a location that stores the installers and packages you can use in R. Selecting 0-Cloud will be a good choice regardless of where you're at. After selecting a mirror you'll be directed to a page to download R for Linux, MacOS, or Windows. Select your OS and download R.

Once R finishes downloading, run the installer with the default settings and R will be ready to go on your system!

The next step will be setting up our code editing environment, R Studio.
