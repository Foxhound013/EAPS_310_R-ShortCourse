# Loading Data in R
  There are a variety of ways to get data loaded into R. In this section, we'll go over some of the basics of loading data with base R functions. We'll also very quickly cover reading data with the data.table package since that'll be a necessity if you want to work with much larger datasets in the future (this won't be neccesary for this class but its good to know for the future).

  The rest of this section can be found in the R script contained in this folder, **loadingData.R**. Instruction in this file will be in the form of comments and in class discussion.

  The csv file used in the section can be found at https://datahub.io/core/co2-ppm#data. If you have questions about what any of the column names are referring to, check out the link!
