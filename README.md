 This repository acts as a home for a quick introduction to working with R for Purdue's EAPS 310.

## Introduction
For many of you this class will be the first time you've interacted with R, and that's okay! The aim of this short course in R is to get you up to speed with the basics and on your way to completing assignments efficiently in R as well as giving you the tools to use R elsewhere in your career as you move forward. This document will lay out the short course for you with short descriptions of each section.
