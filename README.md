# EAPS_310_R-ShortCourse
 This repository acts as a home for a quick introduction to working with R for Purdue's EAPS 310.

 Note, none of these sections below will make you a master of the topic tackled. You'll need to spend a lot of time practicing and working with R if you want to get better. The information provided here is intended to make getting off the ground and started much easier to a newcomer. 
 As you get started with R, don't be discouraged by having to look things up on the internet every 30 seconds or couple of minutes. You're going to get stuck and be frustrated but that is perfectly normal! It's a part of the process. You're learning every step of the way, even if it doesn't feel like it. Trust me when I say, we've all been there. Good luck and best wishes!

## Introduction
  For many of you this class will be the first time you've interacted with R, and that's okay! The aim of this short course in R is to get you up to speed with the basics and on your way to completing assignments efficiently in R as well as giving you the tools to use R elsewhere in your career as you move forward. This document will lay out the short course for you with short descriptions of each section.
