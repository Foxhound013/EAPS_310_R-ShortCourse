# Data Types in R
  There are a variety of data types in R. This section will serve as a very quick overview and is in no way intended to be an exhaustive explanation of each of the data types. The point here is to give you the basics.
  
  Some of the most common data types in R are as follows:
  - integer
    - These are simply whole numbers like 1, 16, -14, etc.
  - numeric 
    - Numeric data in R is the default data type. If you come from other programming backgroudnds, this is your typical float. If you haven't taken programming before, a numeric is simply a number with some decimal places.
  - character
    - Again, if you're from other programming backgrounds, this is simply a string. If you haven't taken programming before, a character is just letters. Some examples are 'Dog' or "Cat". Notice that in those two examples, the single quote and double quote were both used. You can use either in R. It makes little difference, you just have to make sure to match them up.
  - logical
    - These are your boolean values or TRUE/FALSE values.

# Data Structures in R
  There are a variety of data structures in R. How do these differ from data types in R? A data structure is intended to hold a group of data. In some cases the data will be of various types and in others they will all be the same type.

  The common structures in R are as follows:
  - vector
  - list
  - matrix
  - data frame
  - factors
  
  The only data structure that I'm going to cover at length here is the data frame. All of these strucutres are important and useful but you will be working with data frames pretty regularly in this class.

  The data frame can be thought of much like an excel sheet. It's a grouping of columns and rows where each column is a variable. Each column has its own data type but a single dataframe can have columns of multiple data types.
